I&amp;rsquo;ve previously used flock to ensure that multiple instances of my bash script couldn&amp;rsquo;t run at the same time.
I started by writing some bash scripts to test some assumptions main.sh:

Here are some tricks to help folks make the most out of MKCad: Easy way to find Official MKCad documents Using the newly created MKCAD label Inserting from MKCad without reassembling
One common annoyance is when adding parts from MKCAD avoid all the copies.</description></item><item><title>Onshape Featurescript FRC</title><link>https://techplexlabs.com/posts/onshape-featurescript-frc/</link><pubDate>Sat, 06 Feb 2021 10:44:31 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://techplexlabs.com/posts/onshape-featurescript-frc/</guid><description>Quick list of handy featurescripts for Onshape:

My end goal is to make my handwritten notes searchable.
It seems the reMarkable is doing some sort of line simplification before sending the raw x, y coordinates to the MyScript Handwriting Recognition Service (HWR) service.
The following images show initial plotting of the line segments from the binary lines files vs the data sent by the tablet to the HWR service:</description></item><item><title>What Are the Red Green Bars on effects in xLights</title><link>https://techplexlabs.com/posts/what-are-the-red-green-bars-xlights/</link><pubDate>Sun, 22 Nov 2020 21:47:38 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://techplexlabs.com/posts/what-are-the-red-green-bars-xlights/</guid><description>While working on importing the 2020 xLights around the world sequence &amp;ldquo;Into the Unknown&amp;rdquo; we noticed the red and green bars on some effects in the sequence. They look like this: After some prodding we discovered the red line means transition out, whereas the green line indicates a transition in.
To create or edit a transition the controls on the Layer Blending menu.
Here is a sample effect with a fade transition in: Here is a sample effect with a fade transition out:</description></item><item><title>Cannot Render Onto Model... in xLights</title><link>https://techplexlabs.com/posts/cannot-render-onto-model/</link><pubDate>Mon, 23 Nov 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://techplexlabs.com/posts/cannot-render-onto-model/</guid><description>After importing the 2020 xLights around the world sequence &amp;ldquo;Into the Unknown&amp;rdquo; we noticed some of the effects we were attempting to map to our spiral pixel trees did not look as expected.
